									<h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=9&coid=37024" target="_blank">Fundamentals of Web Development</a></h2>
								</header>
									<strong>Class identification: PROG109<br>
									Instructor: Adam Brehm</strong><br>
                  							Introduces fundamental programming techniques using current web development software. 
									Students design procedures and write computer instructions to solve business problems, 
									learn procedural programming, develop graphical user interfaces for the web and work with events and objects.<br>
								 	
									<strong>What did you know before this class? </strong><br>
									I used to have a blog when I was in high school and I remember digging through the html code whenever I wanted to change the design of my page.
									Although I had no idea what I was doing I would almost every time figure it out. And I would have so much fun!
									This summer I decided to take a Python course and it helped me to build a more logical way of thinking. I also learned some terms used in this class.<br>
									
									<strong>What knowledge/skills did you gain after this class? </strong><br>
									Through this class I have learned how to develop Web Pages using html elements; 
									how to use variables with appropriate data-types and scope; 
									how to use appropriate arithmetic, logical and comparison operators to develop complex expressions; 
									how to apply inline, embedded, and external cascading style sheets (CSS) utilizing relative and absolute positioning; 
									how to optimize images for web page display; 
									how to instantiate and use objects (including web forms and controls) and create JavaScript functions; 
									how to code event-driven procedures (event-handlers).
