Final Project Part 2.1

What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript?

Prior to this class I didn’t have any knowledge in both CSS and JavaScript. I did have some contact with HTML years ago when I used to have a blog and would edit the html template to change some things.

Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?

I used a template from http://html5up.net to build my portfolio.

What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?

The most challenging part was building/understanding the JavaScript functions for the artifacts, also finding information on my own since some of them – more specifically the “contact form validation” artifact – didn’t have orientation on how to do it.

How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? 

Through this class I was able to understand better how the whole process starts and all the steps necessary to build a website. Such as starting from the page structure, then implementing the designs with CSS and finally promoting interaction with the user with JavaScript.

What would you recommend to future students taking this class?

I would recommend to be self-motivated and curious, look for information in all places and have fun with it. There are a lot of resources out there and a lot you can do with the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
